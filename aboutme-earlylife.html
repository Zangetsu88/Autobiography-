            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
               "Vincent F. Pitalbo is a first-year BSIT student at Veritas College of Irosin, where he is exploring the world of technology and working toward his dream of becoming an IT professional. Born on September 11, 2006, in the peaceful town of Irosin, Sorsogon, Vincent stands 174 cm tall and weighs 56 kg. Known for his curiosity and eagerness to learn, he is always seeking new knowledge and skills. Outside of his studies, Vincent enjoys playing strategy games, spending time with friends, and discovering new interests. He is a hardworking and driven individual, ready to face challenges and turn them into opportunities for growth."

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>
               "Vincent F. Pitalbo spent his childhood in Brgy. Salvacion, a place that holds some of his happiest memories. Life was simple yet full of joyâ€”he spent his days playing tumbang preso and patintero with friends, climbing trees, and riding bikes around the neighborhood. Rainy afternoons were especially magical as he and his friends raced paper boats down streams of water or splashed through puddles without a care. Vincent's family has always been his greatest inspiration, instilling in him the values of kindness, resilience, and community. These cherished moments shaped the person he is today, reminding him to stay grounded while pursuing his dreams."
